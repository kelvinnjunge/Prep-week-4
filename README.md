Electric Car-Sharing Data Analysis
The proliferation of energy efficient and/or clean sources of energy has driven manufacturers to respond to customer and environmental demands as climate change is ever becoming a threat to humanity and it's habitat. In response to that, there has been substantial growth in the electric car industry and an unforseen subsector of electric car-sharing. The given dataset in this analysis consisted of observations over nine days on electric car (bluecar) ride-sharing and analysis was carried out to understand usage over time. Key questions were used to guide the analysis and gauge whether the main objectives set before were achieved.
